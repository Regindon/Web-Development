This is a Py project to clean Tradovate(Works on Ninjatrader web too probably) trading excel export for trade informations that has been done. 

I made this so that I can have a better understanding of my trades about when I win the most or when I lose the most. I categorize trades with how long was trade duration, when was trade taken for example if its in 0-30mins after market opens or 2+ hours after market opens. How long was trade duration, or what was the ATR(14) value at 1min and 5min candle that I took the trade. I fetch ATR data from Yahoo Finance since its a free resource.
